# digitization_tools
Tools for managing and analyzing digitization workflows for natural history collections.

productivity.py - Generates a productivity report based on the creation timestamps of image files.
crop.py - (coming soon) Creates a cropped image of just the primary herbarium label, used for metadata extraction in crowdsourced workflows.
barcode.py - (coming soon) Extracts barcodes from images and renames files using barcode data.


Instructions:  
These are very minimal right now, but should get you started. A virtual environment is optional but perhaps useful to reduce clutter and conflicts in your primary Python environment.

Create a virtual environment (optional):  
virtualenv env

Activate the virtual environment (optional):  
source env/bin/activate

Install required Python modules:
pip install -r requirements.txt

See details for each tool in their respective directories.
